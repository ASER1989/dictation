# Dictation
## 简介(Introduce)

孩子上小学了，每天都要回家听写所学的字词。为了让自己和孩子都能轻松一些，我设计了这个听写辅助程序，它有以下几个特点和功能：

+ 它可以根据您的设置，定时朗读听写内容，您可以调整朗读的间隔时间和次数，以控制听写的总时长。
+ 它使用系统语音合成技术，可以保证朗读的音准和清晰度，避免了人工辅助可能存在的读音不准或模糊的问题。
+ 它可以减轻听写者的压力，让他们可以自主地完成听写任务，不需要担心父母的陪伴或督促。
+ 它也可以用于自学者的学习需求，当他们没有人可以帮助他们听写时，他们可以使用这个程序来复习和巩固所学的字词。

这个听写辅助程序是我为了孩子和自己的方便而设计的，希望它也能帮助到其他有类似需求的人。

My child is in elementary school and he has to do dictation of the words he learned every day when he comes home. To make it easier for both of us, I designed this dictation assistant program, which has the following features and functions:

+ It can read the dictation content at a set time, and you can adjust the reading interval and times to control the total duration of the dictation.
+ It uses system’s speech synthesis technology, which can ensure the accuracy and clarity of the reading, and avoid the possible problems of inaccurate or vague pronunciation that may occur with human assistance.
+ It can reduce the pressure of the dictator, and let them complete the dictation task independently, without worrying about the accompaniment or supervision of their parents.
+ It can also be used for the learning needs of self-learners, when they have no one to help them with dictation, they can use this program to review and consolidate the words they have learned.

This dictation assistant program is designed for the convenience of my child and myself, and I hope it can also help other people who have similar needs.
